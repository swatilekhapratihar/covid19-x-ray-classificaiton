# X-Ray Pneumonia Detection

This repository contains my experiments with Pneumonia detection based on the X-ray of the lungs using the Tensorflow library.


## Dataset 

The dataset used for the project is available at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia

The dataset is organized into 3 folders (train, test, val) and contains subfolders for each image category (Pneumonia/Normal). There are 5,863 X-Ray images (JPEG) and 2 categories (Pneumonia/Normal).

## Results

With the hyperparameters in the code, the model was able to perform with an accuracy of ~80% on the test data.
